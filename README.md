###Organization:

- Address

###User:
- First Name
- Email
- Address
- Phone
- Last Name

###Instructions

Design and implement a simple application serving a RESTful API to perform operations on Organization as well as
Users. You may use any language, framework, or object-relational mapping of your choice and create any additional
fields and classes you desire. We are looking to see how you design and implement your model as well as your
application. We expect to be able to trace an endpoint down to the data transfer objects (DTO) that represent
Organizations and Users. Feel free to provide additional documentation (UML, SQL scripts, comments, etc) that may
communicate your design choices. We expect your API to support the following operations:

- Create a single Organization
- Create a single User
- Add a User to an Organization
- Delete a User from an Organization
- Read all Users who belong to a specific Organization
- Read all Organizations to which a User belongs
